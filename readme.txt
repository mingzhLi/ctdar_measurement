Evaluation Tool for the ICDAR 2019 Competition on Table Detection and Recognition
This tool relies on Numpy and Shapely package.
I have made some improvements based on the previous version, which speeds up the valuation process and make it possible to evaluate those big tables with nearly 1000 cells in linear time.

Usage:
The command line takes 4 parameters as input.
Specify your track with 3rd parameter as flag: -trackA, -trackB1 or -trackB2
Specify your result file (must be a .tar.gz file) with the 4th parameter.


Example:
1. python evaluate.py -trackA ./your-file-path/you-file-name.tar.gz

2. python evaluate.py -trackB1 ./your-file-path/you-file-name.tar.gz

3. python evaluate.py -trackB2 ./your-file-path/you-file-name.tar.gz


Additional Notes:
python evaluate.py -trackA ./result-files/reg.tar.gz
run the above command for a example test.
